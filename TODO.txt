Bugs
	Searching for drinks with several ratings... Doesn't return anything
	Southern panel disappears when Add ingredient button is clicked... 
	AddIngredient windows: Auto suggest should be implemented better. Currently it might fail because of some threading problem.

Version 2.0
	Wait on loading images until all drink data has been collected => Speed up the time the user has to wait before ordering a drink
	Configuration: Load, save and delete => notify listeners
	Try to collect images both as PNG but also as JPEG
	Locally saved drinks takes up 8.22GB of space...Maybe a bit too much :)
	Be able to save both user defined but also web collected drinks
